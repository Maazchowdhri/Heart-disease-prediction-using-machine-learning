# Heart-disease-prediction-system
Heart Disease Prediction Web Application
This is a simple web application built with Flask that uses a pre-trained Random Forest model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data.

Features
Single Prediction: Enter a patient's details into a form to get an instant prediction.

Bulk Prediction: Upload a CSV file containing data for multiple patients and receive a downloadable CSV with an added 'prediction' column.

User-Friendly UI: A clean and simple interface built with Tailwind CSS.

All-in-One: The entire application (Python backend and HTML/CSS/JS frontend) is contained within a single app.py file for simplicity.

Setup and How to Run
Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.6+ installed on your system.

The random_forest_heart_model.pkl file, which you should have generated by running the random_forest_heart_prediction.py notebook.

Step 1: Set up a Project Directory
Create a new folder for your project and navigate into it:

mkdir heart-disease-app
cd heart-disease-app

Step 2: Place Required Files
Place the following two files inside your heart-disease-app directory:

app.py (the Flask application code you just received).

random_forest_heart_model.pkl (the trained model file).

Your folder structure should look like this:

heart-disease-app/
├── app.py
└── random_forest_heart_model.pkl

Step 3: Install Dependencies
You'll need to install Flask and other required Python libraries. It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
# source venv/bin/activate

# Install the required packages
pip install Flask pandas scikit-learn

Step 4: Run the Application
Now, you can run the Flask application:

python app.py

You should see output similar to this in your terminal:

 * Serving Flask app 'app'
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on <URL>
Press CTRL+C to quit

Step 5: Access the UI
Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided in the terminal, which is usually:
<Url>

You should now see the heart disease prediction user interface and can start making predictions!
